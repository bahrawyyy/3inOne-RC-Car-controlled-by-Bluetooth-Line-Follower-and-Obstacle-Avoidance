# Multi mode robot car that features :
	- Manual mode 
	- Line follower - 'W' 
	- Obstacle avoidance - 'U'

In case of Simultion, you have to comment the part that uses the bluetooth module (mySerial), and uncomment all the ones that use the Serial monitor, or you could just use the (.hex) file provided.

Also in simulation, in Line follower mode, after changing the readings of any of the sensors, you have to press 'W' - again. this runs perfectly in hardware, this bug appears in proteus only.

If you want to use switches instead of serial monitor in switching between the modes, it runs perfectly
